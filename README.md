# Project Title
Using NASA's APIs to Showcase Space Images

# Project Description
This project is a simple yet captivating web application that leverages three of NASA's APIs to showcase stunning space images and videos. It provides users with an interactive way to explore the beauty of the cosmos by selecting specific dates and camera types. The application is designed to be user-friendly and educational, making space exploration accessible to everyone.

# Features
1. Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)
Daily Space Image: Users can view the Astronomy Picture of the Day, which includes a high-quality image or video along with a detailed explanation provided by NASA.
Date Selection: Users can select any date to view the corresponding APOD. If the selected date is in the future, the application gracefully handles the error and informs the user that the data is not yet available.
2. Mars Rover Photos
Mars Rover Images: Users can explore images captured by NASA's Mars Rovers (Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit) on specific Earth dates.
Camera Selection: Users can choose from various cameras mounted on the Rovers (e.g., FHAZ, RHAZ, MAST) to view images from different perspectives.
Pagination: The application supports pagination to navigate through multiple pages of Rover photos, allowing users to explore more images captured on the selected date.
3. Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)
Earth Images: Users can view stunning images of Earth captured by NASA's EPIC instrument aboard the DSCOVR spacecraft.
Date Selection: Users can select a specific date to view the images of Earth taken on that day.
Image Information: The application provides detailed information about each image, including the capture time and position of the DSCOVR spacecraft.

# Technologies Used
HTML5: The backbone structure of the application, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.
CSS3: For styling the application, making it visually appealing and responsive across devices.
JavaScript: For handling API requests, user interactions, and dynamic content updates.
